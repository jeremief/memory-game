## Description
This project forms part of Udacity's Front End Web Developer nanodegree.

The purpose is to create a memory game utilizing JHTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

The user has to match eight sets of cards, being able to only uncover two at a time. The page has a timer and move counter to keep track of the player's performance.
The game ends when the player has matched all the cards.



## How to install
To obtain the files in this directory, you can either fork the repository in your own directory or download a zip file to your own machine and extract it. Either way, you should have the unzipped folder on your machine to be able to run it.

You will find the following files:
* README.md: this file
* index.html: the html page containing the memory game
* app.css: the css file used to format index.html
* app.js: the JavaScript code used for this project
* screenshot.png: a screenshot used for github.
* geometry2.png: used for the game's background

Once this is done, you can open index.html in your browser.
